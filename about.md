My name is Pankaj Singh and I am a software artisan from India. I am an Open Source Enthusiast and Evangelist. I've been shipping software solutions mainly web applications for more than 2 years.

I am a graduate from Uttar Pradesh Technical University and I did Post Graduate Diploma in System Software Development from Centre for Development in Advanced Computing(C-DAC), Hyderabad. C-DAC is a premier institute under the Government of India and it is the place which molded me to be an Open Source Contributor. 

I believe that software development is an art, and every artist has his own ways of expressing his thoughts.
